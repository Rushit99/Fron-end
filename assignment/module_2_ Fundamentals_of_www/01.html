    <h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>

    <div class="phase">
        <h2>1. Planning</h2>
        <p>This phase involves defining the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project. Stakeholders gather
            requirements and outline the project plan.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phase">
        <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
        <p>In this phase, detailed requirements are gathered and analyzed. This includes functional and non-functional
            requirements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phase">
        <h2>3. Design</h2>
        <p>The system architecture and design are created based on the requirements. This includes high-level design
            (HLD) and low-level design (LLD).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phase">
        <h2>4. Implementation (Coding)</h2>
        <p>This is the phase where actual coding takes place. Developers write code according to the design
            specifications.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phase">
        <h2>5. Testing</h2>
        <p>The software is tested to identify and fix defects. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system
            testing, and user acceptance testing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phase">
        <h2>6. Deployment</h2>
        <p>The software is deployed to a production environment where users can access it. This may involve staging and
            production releases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phase">
        <h2>7. Maintenance</h2>
        <p>After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated and improved based on user
            feedback and changing requirements.</p>
    </div>
